1) Problem with ([1,2,3,4] !! 3) + 4 . This is a grammar problem, i tried to change grammar to fix this and got 17 reduce reduce errors so i was like nah i'm good. I use elem(xs,x) = xs !! 3 (as a work around since function needs to be evaluated) -> not a good solution.
2) < is actually <= (i used <= in programs to solve this)
